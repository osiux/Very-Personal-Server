=========About=========
Once there was a WRT160NL router, it needed to download so many stuff and to be controlled by two persons. 
One of the controllers knew how to code.
The other one barely could use a line command.
Also the main controller was all day working at a firewalled network.
So this trail begun.

The intention of this app is to control remotely a home media network. So far is capable to do everything about torrents using tranmission-daemon.
